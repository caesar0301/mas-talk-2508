# **RAG System**

* Overview of Retrieval-Augmented Generation
* Architecture: Retriever + Generator
* Use cases: QA, search, summarization
* Challenges: latency, hallucination, stale knowledge

# **AI Agent**

* Definition: Task-oriented autonomous entities
* Capabilities: Perception, decision, and action
* From chatbot to tool-using agent
* Single-agent vs multi-step execution

# **Agentic AI - Multi-Agent System**

* Why multi-agent? Scalability, specialization, resilience
* Agent collaboration and communication
* Examples: Planning agent + Executor agent + Memory agent
* Architectures: Hub & Spoke, Decentralized, LangGraph

# **Core Technologies**

## **Engineering Essentials**

* **PPT: Planning – Prompts – Tools**

  * Planning: procedural, goal-based, reactive
  * Prompt design as logic, not just input
  * Tools: APIs, calculators, web search, databases

## **Agentic Memory**

* Types: short-term (context window) vs long-term (external memory)
* Vector stores, episodic memory, task memory
* Self-referential memory for autonomy

## **Keep Agents on Track**

* Procedural task control & error recovery
* Planning-enhanced prompt flows
* From prompt engineering → context engineering
* Task decomposition + memory grounding

# **Advanced Agentic Tech.**

## **Self-evolving Agent (Gödel Agent)**

* Self-referencing and reflection
* Self-prompting and self-correction
* Life-long learning through feedback and memory
* Analogous to Gödelian self-description

# **Towards World Agent Web (WAW)**

* Agents as nodes in a global network
* Interoperability standards and shared memory
* Persistent, evolving agents with identities
* Vision: global ecosystem of coexisting, cooperating agents
